# React Kotlin Demo
A simple project to explore running a React Native app within a larger Android app
built in with Kotlin.

The basic Android app architecture is a single Activity / multiple Fragment design. 
The React Native app runs in two or more fragments, each fragment displaying a 
different aspect of the same app.
There are additional fragments with native Android content.
